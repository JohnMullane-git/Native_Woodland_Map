## Data 

The National Parks and Wildlife Service completed a national survey of Native Woodlands in the Republic of Ireland between 2003 and 2008.
These data were collated into pdf documents from the [NPWS](https://www.npws.ie/publications/search?title=national%20survey%20of%20native%20woodlands&keyword=&author=&series=All&year=&x=43&y=9&items_per_page=10).
                                                  
The information for the pin map and data table was scraped from these pdf documents.
These pins can then be toggled by the user and more information about the woodland will be visible like the size in hectares, it's conservation status etc.

The shapefile map data was pulled from [gov.ie](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/national-survey-of-native-woodlands-2003-2008/resource/f84a1220-a521-4ed0-8bce-209098c19500?inner_span=True). This link also contains a mapping tool where the woodlands' locations can be viewed.

## Limitations

The pin map scraped the townland names from the pdfs for latitude and longitude.                                                                                          
Some data points on the shapefile map have different location data. The locations of these woods (<5%) may be incorrect in the initial map.  
Amendments to these locations may be made over time.
