# Native_Woodland_Map
Creating a map of Native Woodlands in Ireland using NPWS data collected.

The National Parks and Wildlife Service did a national survey of all the Native Woodlands in Ireland between 2003 and 2008.
These data were collated into pdf documents which can be viewed here:

The goal of this project is to extract the relevant data and create a map with the locations of the native woodlands denoted by pins on the map.
These pins can then be toggled by the user and more information about the woodland will be visible like the size in hectares, it's quality rating etc...
