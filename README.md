## Data 

The National Parks and Wildlife Service completed a national survey of Native Woodlands in the Republic of Ireland between 2003 and 2008.
These data were collated into pdf documents on the [NPWS website](https://www.npws.ie/publications/search?title=national%20survey%20of%20native%20woodlands&keyword=&author=&series=All&year=&x=43&y=9&items_per_page=10). The information for the map and data table were scraped from these pdf documents. The pins on the map can be toggled by the user and information about the woodland will be visible.

## Code
The code for this project can be viewed on [github](https://github.com/JohnMullane-git/Native_Woodland_Map).

## Limitations

The map scraped the townland names from the pdfs for latitude and longitude. [gov.ie](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/national-survey-of-native-woodlands-2003-2008) also hosts a data of this woodland survey. The link contains a mapping tool where the woodlands' locations can be viewed. Some woodland locations on the [gov.ie](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/national-survey-of-native-woodlands-2003-2008) map are different to this map. Amendments to these locations will be made over time.
