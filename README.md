## Map of Native Woodlands in Ireland using NPWS data.

## Data 

The National Parks and Wildlife Service completed a national survey of Native Woodlands in the Republic of Ireland between 2003 and 2008.
These data were collated into pdf documents which can be viewed here:                                                                                                                                                                 
https://www.npws.ie/publications/search?title=national%20survey%20of%20native%20woodlands&keyword=&author=&series=All&year=&x=43&y=9&items_per_page=10
                                                  
The information for the pin map and data table was scraped from these pdf documents.
These pins can then be toggled by the user and more information about the woodland will be visible like the size in hectares, it's conservation status etc.

The shapefile map data was pulled from here:

This link also contains a mapping tool where the woodlands' locations can be viewed.

## Limitations

The pin map scraped the data and used the townland names for latitude and longitude.                                                                                          
The shapefile map has some different location data, so some woods (~5%) locations may be incorrect in the initial map.
